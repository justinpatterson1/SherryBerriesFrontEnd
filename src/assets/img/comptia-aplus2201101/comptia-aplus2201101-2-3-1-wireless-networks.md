## Wireless Protocols

At the end of this episode, I will be able to:

1. Identify wireless protocols


Exam Objective: *2.3 - Compare and contrast protocols for wireless networking.*

Description: In this episode, we discuss common protocols used in wireless network communication. We will identify the Institute for Electrical and Electronics Engineers \(IEEE\) 802.11 standards, wireless channels, the 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz frequencies, Bluetooth, NFC, RFID and long-range fixed wireless.

-----------------------------------------------------------


* **Frequencies and channels**
	+ ISM \(Industrial, Scientific and Medical\) \(FCC\)
	+ UNII \(Unlicensed - National Information Infrastructure) \(U-NI)
	+ 2.4 GHz \(Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, cordless devices, medical devices\)
		- 13 channels \(11 channels in North America, 3 non-overlapping\)
	+ 5 GHz \(less saturation, wider channels through bonding\)
		- 23 non-overlapping channels
* **802.11**
	+ .11a
	+ .11b
	+ .11g
	+ .11n \(Wi-Fi 4\)
	+ .11ac \(Wi-Fi 5\)
	+ .11ax \(WiFi 6\)
* **Bluetooth**
	+ 2.4 GHz frequency/ 10 meters or 32.8 ft.
	+ Multiple revisions
		- Standards \(formerly 802.15.1, today Bluetooth SIG\)
			* 1.1 - Legacy \(First standardization\) 1 Mbps
			* 2.0 - Bluetooth + EDR \(Enhanced Data Rate\) 3 Mbits
			* 3.0 - Bluetooth + HS \(High speed, 24 Mbps via co allocated Wi-Fi channel)
			* 4.0 - Bluetooth + LE \(Low energy implementations, focus begins on IoT\)
			* 5.0 - Varity of revisions of this version
	+ **Near Field Communications \(NFC\)**
		- point-to-point contact/0-2 cm
		- 13.56 MHz
		- Contactless payment
		- Proximity cards
		- Asset tracking
	+ **Radio-frequency identification**
		- Unpowered/powered tags cards to store data
		- Powered tags can increase the range up to 100 meters
		- Components
			* Tag \(sends data to the reader\)
			* Reader \()
			* Antenna
	+ **Long-range fixed wireless**
		- Licensed and unlicensed bands
		- Farther distances than traditional Wi-Fi \(160 ft/kilometer)
