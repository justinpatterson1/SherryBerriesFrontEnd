#Motherboards

At the end of this episode, I will be able to:

1. Identify motherboard technologies.

Exam Objective: *Given a scenario, install and configure motherboards, central processing units (CPUs), and add-on cards.*

Description: In this episode, we will dive into motheroards. We will discuss different form factors such as ATX, ITX and BTX as well as motherboard connection types and compatibility.

------------------------------------------------

* Motherboard form factor
	+ Advanced Technology eXtended \(ATX\)
		- 12 x 9.6in
		- 20/20+4/24 pin PSU connector
		- PS/2 ports
		- I/O panel \(standardized\)
		- Air flow \(push/pull\)
		- CPU/PSU fan placement
	- Information Technology eXtended \(ITX\)
		- developed by VIA Technologies
		- low power
		- fanless \(passive\) cooling
		- Same specs as ATX
	- Balanced Technology eXtended \(BTX\)
		- Intended to be a replacement for ATX
		- Better thermal design
		- Hardware components are mounted closer together.
* Motherboard Connector Types
	+ Peripheral Component Interconnect \(PCI\)
	+ PCI Express
	+ Power connectors
		- 20/20+4/24 pin main power connector
		- 4 pin CPU connector \(P4\)
		- 8 pin CPU connector \(EPS\)
	+ SATA ports \(7-pin connector\)
	+ M.2
	+ Headers
	+ CPU and system fans
* Motherboard compatibility
	+ Intel vs. AMD
	+ Server \(non-standardized\)
	+ Laptop \(non-standardized\)
	+ Mobile \(non-standardized\)
	+ Desktop/workstation \(non-standardized and standardized\)
