 ##Processors

At the end of this episode, I will be able to:

1.  Identify characteristics and features of central processing units.
Exam Objective: * 3.4 - Given a scenario, install and configure motherboards, central processing units (CPUs), and add-on cards.*

Description: In this episode, we discuss central processing units or CPUs, their characteristics, features and attributes.


-----------------------------------------------------------

* CPU **Architecture**
	+ **x64 vs. x86**
		- 64-bit vs. 32-bit
		- 4 GB memory \(RAM\) limitation in 32-bit
	+ Acorn RISC Machine \(**ARM**\)
		- Low power
		- Passively cooled
		- Mobile devices
		- 32-bit and 64-bit
	+ **Single core and Multicore**
	+ **Multithreading** \(Demo in Task Manager\)
		- Intel = Hyperthreading \(logically dividing physical cores\)
		- AMD = Simultaneous Multithreading \(SMT\)
	+ Virtualization support
	+ **Socket Types**
		- Land grid array \(LGA\)
		- Pin grid array \(PGA\)
		- Ball grid array \(BGA\)
	+ Intel **CPUs and Sockets**
		- 7th Gen
			* i7, i9 = LGA2066
			* i7 = LGA1151
		- 8th and 9th Gen
			* i7,i5,i3 = LGA1151 \(Socket H4\)
		- 10th Gen
			* i9,i7,i5,i3 = LGA1200
		- Xeon
			* LGA2066
	+ AMD CPUs and Sockets
		- Ryzen = Socket TR4 \(LGA-based\)
		- Ryzen = AM4 Socket
		- Athlon = AM2+
		- Athlon/Sempron= FM2
		- Eypc and Opteron
