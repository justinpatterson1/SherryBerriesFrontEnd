##Network Types

At the end of this episode, I will be able to:

1.  Identify network types.

Exam Objective: *2.7 - Compare and contrast Internet connection types, network types, and their features.*



Description: In this episode, we will compare and contrast common network types such as personal area networks \(PAN\), local area networks \(LANs\), virtual local area networks \(VLANS),wide area networks \(WANs\), metropolitan area networks \(PANs) as well as storage area networks \(SAN\).

----------------------------------------------------------------

* Network types
	+ Personal area network \(**PAN**\)
		- Computer, printer, webcam
	+ Local area network \(**LAN**\)
		- a self-contained network spanning a single geographical location
		- Private links
	+ Virtual local area network \(**VLAN**\)
		- Uses managed switches
		- Groups a set of ports together to for a VLAN
		- Switch uses identifiers to ensure that data bound for VLAN is not sent to another VLAN
	+ Wide area network \(**WAN**\)
		- A network that spans multiple geographical locations
			* Further than a city, can be state-to-state or city-to-city
		- Typically connects multiple LANS
		- Contains public links \(or ISP provided\)
	+ Metropolitan area network \(**MAN**\)
		- A network that spans a city
		- 
	+ Storage area network \(**SAN**\)
		- A collection of storage devices
		- High speed, fiber optic communications
