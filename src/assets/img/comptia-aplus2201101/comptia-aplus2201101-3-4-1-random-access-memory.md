#Random-access Memory

At the end of this episode, I will be able to:

1. Identify common random-access memory attributes and standards.

Exam Objective: *3.2 - Given a scenario, install the appropriate RAM.*

Description: In this episode, we will discuss random-access memory or RAM as well as considerations for installing RAM, specifications and standards.


------------------------------------------------

* What is **RAM**?
	+ Volatile, temporary workspace for data.
	+ The more data you want to be actively working on, the more RAM you will need.
	+ Modules are made up of a PCB and RAM chips
	+ Standardization allows us to know that electrical capabilities and the physical shape.
	+ Each standard provides a unique set of features
		- Perform enhancements
		- Lower power consumption
	+ Best practice - install the same type and speed of memory in a system.
	+ A lower speed module will cause all modules to operate at the lowest common speed.
	+ **Multichannel** architecture
		- Single
		- Double
		- Triple
		- Quad
	+ **Form factors**
		- Dual inline memory modules \(**DIMM**\)
		- Small Outline DIMM \(**SODIMM**\)
	+ **Standards**
		- **SDR** SDRAM
			* 168 pins DIMMs
		- **DDR** SDRAM
			* 184 pin DIMMs
			* 200 pin SODIMMs
			* PC-1600,PC-2100, PC-2700, PC-3200
		- **DDR2** SDRAM
			* 240 pin DIMMs
			* 200 pin SODIMMs
			* PC2-3200, PC2-4266, PC2-5333, PC2-6400 and 8533
		- **DDR3** SDRAM
			* 240 pin DIMMs
			* 204 pin SODIMMs
			* PC3-6400, PC3-8500, PC3-10600, PC3-12800, PC3-14900
			* 16 GBs per DIMM
		- **DDR4** SDRAM
			* 288 pin DIMMs
			* 260 pins SODIMMs
			* 64 GB per DIMM
			* PC4-12800, PC4-14900, PC4-17000, PC4-19200, PC4-23466, PC4-25600
		- **DDR5**
			* 288 pins
	+ Error Correcting Code \(**ECC**\)
		- Allows memory to locate and fix errors in data
	+ **Virtual RAM**
		- Page file
		- Treat the local drive as a portion of memory
		- 1.5 times the size of the installed RAM
