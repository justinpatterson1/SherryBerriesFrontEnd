At the end of this episode, I will be able to:

1. Identify PC firmware platforms.

Exam Objective: *3.4 -Given a scenario, install and configure motherboards, central processing units (CPUs), and add-on cards.*

Description: In this episode, we will discuss two major firmware platforms known as Basic Input/Output System \(BIOS\) and Unified Extensible Firmware Interface \(UEFI\) as well as compare their respective features.


------------------------------------------------

* What is **firmware**?

* Basic Input/Output System \(**BIOS**\)
	+ Legacy system built in the days of 16-bit systems
	+ Maximum limit of 4 primary partitions
	+ 2 TB volume size max
	+ Uses a Master Boot Record or MBR to boot the system
* Unified Extensible Firmware Interface \(**UEFI**\) settings
	+ More than 4 partitions \(128\)
	+ Volume sizes larger than 2 TB \(9 zettabytes\)
	+ Faster boot times
	+ Uses a GUID Partition Table or GPT to locate and boot the OS
	+ Implements Secure boot
* **Boot options**
	+ Default boot devices
	+ Boot order
* **Monitoring**
	+ Voltages
	+ Timings
	+ Fans
	+ Temperature
* **Security**
	+ Boot password
	+ Chassis Intrusion Detection
	- Trusted Platform Module \(TPM\) 
	- Secure Boot
