-----------------------------------------------------------

* **Purpose** of virtual machines

	+ **Sandbox**

		- Creates an isolated environment

		- Great for learning and test development

	+ **Application virtualization**

		+ Legacy software/OS

			- Example: different versions of the same application

		+ Cross-platform virtualization

			- Allows applications built for a specific platform to operate on other platforms

* **Resource requirements**

	+ Intel-VT and AMD-V CPUs with virtualization enabled

	+ Host machine resources need to be available to host and guest

		- CPU, RAM, storage and memory

	+ Hypervisor \(Type 1 vs. Type 2)

* **Security requirements**

	+ Both virtual machines and the host machines that VMs run on need the same security requirements

	+ Password protection

	+ Antivirus and signature updates
