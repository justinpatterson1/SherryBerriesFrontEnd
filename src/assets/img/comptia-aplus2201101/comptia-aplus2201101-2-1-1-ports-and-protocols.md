## Ports and Protocols





At the end of this episode, I will be able to:

1. Identify TCP and UDP protocols and ports.

Exam Objective: *2.1 - Compare and contrast Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) ports, protocols, and their purposes.*

Description: In this episode, we discuss common protocols used in network communications. We will compare and contrast Transmission Control Protocol \(TCP\) and User Datagram Protocol \(UDP\) and a connection-oriented service vs. a connectionless service.

* What is a **protocol and port**?
* What is are the standardized port ranges?
	+ 0- 1023 = **Well known ports** \(most of the focus\)
	+ 1024-49151 = **Register port ranges** \(a few in this range\)
	- 49152 - 65535 = **Dynamic port ranges**
* What is a connection-oriented service vs. a connectionless service?
	- Reliable delivery vs. best effort delivery
* Protocols List
	+ **Email Protocols**
	 	- SMTP = Port 25
	 	- IMAP = Port 143
	 	- POPv3 = Port 110
	+ **Web Protocols**
		- HTTP = Port 80 \(Demo\)
		- HTTPS = Port 143 \(Demo\)
	+ **File Protocols**
		- FTP = Port 20,21
		- TFTP = Port 69 \(Demo\)
	+ **Remote Connection Protocols**
		- Telnet = 23
		- SSH = 22 \(Demo)
		- RDP = 3389
	 + **Network Services**
	 	- DNS = Port 53 \(Demo\)
	 	- NETBIOS = Port 137/139
	 	- DHCP Port 68 and 67
	 	- SNMP = 161/162
	 	- LDAP = 389
	 	- SMB = 445
