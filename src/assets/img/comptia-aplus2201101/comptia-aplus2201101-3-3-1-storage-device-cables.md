##Storage Device Cables

At the end of this episode, I will be able to:

1. Identify common storage devices cables and connections

Exam Objective: *3.1 - Explain basic cable types and their connectors, features, and purposes.*

Description: In this episode, we will discuss storage device cables and connections. We will discuss IDE, SATA, eSATA, FireWire, and SCSI.


------------------------------------------------

* Integrated Drive Electronics \(**IDE**\)
	+ Older legacy technology
	+ 18" cables \(and non-standardized 24" cables\)
	+ Primary and secondary drives
	+ 2 devices per cable, maximum of 4 devices
	+ 40 and 80 pin varieties
	+ Retro named Parallel ATA or PATA
* Serial Advanced Technology Attachment \(**SATA**\)
	+ Successor to IDE/PATA
	+ Minimum of 12" \(smaller can cause timing/noise interference issues\)
	+ Single device per cable
	+ 4-8 SATA port on motherboards commonly
	+ 7 pin data cable connectors
	+ 15 pin power connectors
* External SATA \(**eSATA**\)
	+ Allows for the connection of SATA enclosures to an external port
	+ 2-meter max cable length
	+ Shielded cable
	+ Largely replaced by faster technologies such as USB and Thunderbolt.
* **FireWire**
	+ IEEE 1394
	+ 12V power
	+ 60+ devices
	+ 400 \(FireWire 400\) and 800 \(FireWire800\) Mbps
* Small Computer System Interface \(**SCSI**\)
	+ Older technology used in enterprises
	+ Costly
	+ Legacy devices used parallel cables
		- Required jumpers to configure *SCSI_IDs*
	+ Newer devices use serial cables
	+ Uses a specialized adapter called a host bus adapter \(HBA\)
