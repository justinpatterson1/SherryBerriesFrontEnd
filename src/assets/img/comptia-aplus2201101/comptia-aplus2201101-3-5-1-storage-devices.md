#Storage Devices

At the end of this episode, I will be able to:

1. Identify storage device technologies.

Exam Objective: *3.3 - Given a scenario, select and install storage devices.*

Description: In this episode, we will discuss a variety of storage device technologies such as hard disk drives, solid-state drives, IDE, SATA, form-factors, M.2, NVMe, flash drives, optical drives, memory cards and RAID configurations.


------------------------------------------------

* **Hard drives**
	+ Magnetic media
	+ Fixed media
	+ **Speeds**
		- 5,400rpm
		- 7,200rpm
		- 10,000rpm
		- 15,000rpm
	+ Communication interfaces
		- **IDE**
		- **SATA**
			* SATA 1.0 = 150 MBps
			* SATA 2.0 = 300 MBps
			* SATA 3.0 = 600 MBPs
		- **SCSI**
* **SSDs**
	+ Communications interfaces
		- Non-volatile Memory Express \(**NVMe**\)
			* Interface specification attached to the PCI Express interface
			* Uses up to 4 PCIe lanes
			* Replaces the SATA interface \(originally designed for mechanical drives)
			* Uses a U.2 connector for solid state drives
		- SATA
* **Form factors**
	+ M.2
		- Examples: 2280 \(22mm wide, 80mm length\)
	+ mSATA
		- Common in portable devices
		- Largely being replaced by M.2
	+ 2.5
	+ 3.5
* **Removable storage**
	+ Flash drives
		- 2 GBs up to 2 TBs
		- USB connector
		- Electrical non-volatile storage
	+ Memory cards
		- Electrical non-volatile storage
		- Commonly used in portable devices
	+ Optical drives
		- Older, almost legacy technology
		- Optically stored data via laser
		- SDcard
		- CompactFlash
		- MMC \(Multi Media Card\)
* Drive configurations
	+ Redundant Array of Independent \(or Inexpensive\) Disks (**RAID**)
