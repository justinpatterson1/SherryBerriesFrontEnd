## Mobile Device Displays



At the end of this episode, I will be able to:



1. Identify mobile device display technologies.



Exam Objective: *1.2 - Compare and contrast the display components of mobile devices.*



Description: In this episode, the we will be discuss the concepts surrounding modern mobile device displays such as passive and active matrix, In-plane switching \(IPS\), Twisted nematic \(TN\), Vertical alignment \(VA\, organic light-emitting diode \(OLED\), touchscreens, contrast ratio, inverters and more.

* Liquid crystal display \(LCD\)

    + Passive matrix

        - Slow changes

        - Blurry images

    + Active matrix

        - Faster changes

        - Brighter images

* In-plane switching \(IPS\)

    + Good - Faster

    + Good - Wider angles

    + Good - Higher color/contrast than many VA and TN panels

    + Good - Color accuracy

    + Bad - Motion blur

* Twisted nematic \(TN\)

    + Good - Fastest response times

    + Good - Reduction of motion blur

    + Good - Lowest cost panel technology

    + Bad - Reduced viewing angle

    + Bad - Reduced color accuracy and contrast ratio

* Vertical alignment \(VA\)

    + Good - Highest contrast than TN panels

    + Good - Wider viewing angles than TN panels

    + Good - Color accuracy

    + Good - High-end VA panels will rival IPS panels

    

``

Contrast ratio is the measured difference between the darkest blacks and the brightest whites a monitor can produce. This measurement provides information about the amount of grayscale detail a monitor will deliver. The higher the contrast ratio, the more visible detail.

* Organic light-emitting diode \(OLED\)

* Touch screens

* Replacement

	- Digitizer

	- Inverter

	- Antenna placement
