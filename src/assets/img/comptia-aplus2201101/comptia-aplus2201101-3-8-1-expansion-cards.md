##Expansion Cards

At the end of this episode, I will be able to:

1.  Identify common expansion cards, their purpose and connections.

Exam Objective: * 3.4 - Given a scenario, install and configure motherboards, central processing units (CPUs), and add-on cards.*

Description: In this episode, we discuss central processing units or CPUs, their characteristics, features and attributes.

* **Expansion Cards**
	+ Sound card \(Show\)
	+ Video card
	+ Capture card \(Show\)
	+ Storage cards \(Show PCIe M.2/SATA card\)
	+ Network interface card \(NIC\) \(Show\)
* **Connection Types**
	+ Peripheral Component Interconnect \(**PCI**\)
		- Local bus/shared bus
		- Bus mastering 
		- Half duplex
		- 133 MBps
		- 32-bit and rare 64-bit cards
	+ PCI Express \(**PCIe**)
		- Serial communication
		- Utilizes single and multilane architecture
		- Multilane implementations are represented by a "x-lane" designation
		- Data is striped across multiple lanes, making the total bandwidth a multiplier of a single lane speed
		- Versions
			* Version 1.x
				+ ×1 = 250 Mps
				+ ×16 = 4 GBps
			* Version 2.x
				+ ×1 = 500 MBps
				+ ×16 = 8 GBps
			* Version 3.x:
				+ ×1 = 985 MBps
				+ ×16 = 15.75 GBps
			* Version 4.x
				+ ×1: 1.97 GBps
				+ ×16: 31.5 GBps
			* Version 5.0
				+ ×1: 3.94 GBps
				+ ×16: 63 GBps
			* Version 6.0
				+ ×1 = 7.56 GB/s
				+ ×16 = 121 GB/s
	+ Accelerated Graphics Port \(**AGP**\)
		- Legacy bus architecture
		- Used for video graphics
		- Replaced by PCIe
	+ Peripheral Component Interconnect eXtended \(**PCI-X**\)
		- Legacy bus architecture
		- 64-bit PCI implementation
		- Server technology
		- Not widely adopted
