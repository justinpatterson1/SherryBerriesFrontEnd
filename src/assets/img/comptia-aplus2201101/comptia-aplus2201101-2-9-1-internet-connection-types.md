##Internet Connection Types



At the end of this episode, I will be able to:

1. Identify common Internet connection methods.

Exam Objective: *2.7 - Compare and contrast Internet connection types, network types,

and their features.*

Description: In this episode, we discuss the popular way in which devices connect to the Internet such as fiber, cable, Dial-up, Public Switched Telephone Network line \(PSTN\), Digital Subscriber Line \(DSL\), cellular, satellite and Wireless Internet Service Providers \(WISPs\)





-----------------------------------------------------------



* Internet connection types

	+ **Fiber \(FiOS)**

		- Use optical network terminals \(ONTs\)

		- Gigabit speeds

	+ **Cable**

		- Coaxial cabling \(RG-6\)

		- Older technology

		- DOCSIS standard

			* Data Over Cable Service Interface Specifications

		- Shared connection

		- Speeds vary

	+ **Dial-up**

		- Digital signals are sent over Public Switched Telephone Network \(PSTN\) or telephone lines

		- 56Kbps

		- Low cost

	- **DSL**

		- Digital Subscriber Line

		- Digital signals over analog telephone lines

		- Allows for the use of phone and Internet at the same time

		- Requires proximity to the telecommunication switch

		- Uses a modem

		- 2 Mbps up to 100 Mbps+ depending on distance

	- **Cellular**

		- Allows for mobile Internet access

		- 2G/3G/4G/5G

		- Availability based on cell tower placement

	- **Satellite**

		- Commonly used for fixed wireless Internet connections

		- Also, sed in rural areas where DSL and cable networks are not present or limited.

		- Line-of-sight \(signal propagation issues\)

		- Affected by weather

	- **Wireless Internet service provider (WISP)**

		- Used in rural areas where DSL and cable networks are not present or limited.

		- Uses a variety of technologies

			* Some are standardized like Wi-Fi mesh networks

			* Some are proprietary in nature

		- Uses a variety of frequencies including 2.4 and 5 GHz

		- Line-of-sight \(signal propagation issues\)

		- Affected by weather
